# Data Engineer Concepts

Target time: 45 mins

## Context

Below are some questions about general Data Engineering concepts and how you might
approach various scenarios. Be detailed in your responses (e.g. include concrete
examples), but please keep your responses to no more than 2 paragraphs.

1. What do you think is important to consider before ingesting data into a
   pre-existing reporting structure? What questions would you ask? What
   information would you seek?
2. How would you build consensus around making changes to data processing or
   pipelines with other members of a multidisciplinary team? How do you know
   when you have an agreement to move forward? What might you consider when
   presenting your proposal to the team?
3. How do you know if you have “good data?” How would you approach cleaning data
   to make it "good data?"

## Deliverables
