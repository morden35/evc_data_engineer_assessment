## Deduped version of Vendor X table

The sql query to create a deduped version of the Vendor X table can be found in vendor_x_registrations_deduped.sql. Unfortunately I was not able to create this table in the SQLPad database due to permission errors (schema "s_f33890ec9c814bb1d9227550d09e9947" does not exist).

## Creating all_records table

The sql query to create the all_records table can be found in all_records_generation_TO_EDIT.sql. Again, I was not able to create this table in the SQLPad database due to the same permission error as above. Additionally, I ran out of time and was not able to format the phone string from the vendor_x_registrations_deduped table as was necessary. I also was not able to convert the registration_date to month and year due to time constraints.
