# Data Engineer Skills Assessment

Thank you for your interest in the Data Engineer position at Everybody Votes
Campaign (EVC)!

The following assessment is an opportunity to demonstrate the extent of your
data engineering knowledge. We will be scoring this assessment on its
completeness and your ability to correctly respond to the prompts. We will also
be looking at your _creativity_ and _critical thinking_ in your responses. It is
best to show and explain your work and thought process, _even if you are unable
to complete the task in full_.

We ask that you carefully read the prompts, document your code, and follow
coding best practices. This includes the expectation that you are storing all
your work in a git repository and making frequent commits.

The tasks are organized in the order in which we reccommend that you complete
them. That is, complete task `01-data-wrangling.md` before moving on to task
`02_sql_queries.md`, etc.

_**Note:** the **Overview** section for each of the tasks it aimed as presenting
a likely scenario you could encouter at EVC._

## Guidelines

- The target time for this assessment is three (3) to four (4) hours
- You have a twenty-four (24) hour window in which to complete the assessment
- You may use online or offline resources
- You may **not** consult nor share this assessment with any other person
- If you use substantial portions of code without significant modification in
  your responses, cite the author and/or source where you found the information.

## Deliverables

All materials should be emailed back to us in a compressed folder (i.e. git
repository). Be sure to include your solutions, as well as any documents you
produce. Please name files appropriately.

## Setup

_Before you get started on the tasks, verify that you can log into the online
platform used in task [`02_sql_queries.md`](./02_sql_queries.md#setup) and that
you are able to connect to the database as described in
[`01_data_wrangling.md`](./01_data_wrangling.md#setup). Login credentials are
your email address and the last four digits of your phone number._
